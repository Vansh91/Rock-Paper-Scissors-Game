# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game
A basic rock paper and scissors game in python
- Here we create 2 global players and get inputs from them.
- We initialize the menu function that gives us the options to start the game, Change player name and quit the game.
- Depending on the choice the player makes we move on to the game.
- Player chooses 'r' for rock, 's' for scissors and 'p' for paper
- The system displays 'invalid input' if the players enters any other option
- We then match the inputs from both players and the program decides the winner
- After the game the players are redirected to the menu section, to restart, play another game or quit.
